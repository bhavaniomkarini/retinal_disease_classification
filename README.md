This is my major project "Enhanced Deep Learning Model for Retinal Disease Classification Using OCT Images". This model is built on the VGG-19 architecture, a proprietary 19-layer deep convolutional neural network. Additionally, it is compared with three other models, namely Resnet50, Resnet152, and Densenet121, with the same dataset of 84k images.
