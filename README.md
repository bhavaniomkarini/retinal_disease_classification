This is my major project "Enhanced Deep Learning Model for Retinal Disease Classification Using OCT Images". This model is built on the VGG-19 architecture, a proprietary 19-layer deep convolutional Neural Network. Additionally, it is compared with three other models, namely ResNet-50, ResNet-152, and DenseNet-121, with the same dataset of 84k images.
